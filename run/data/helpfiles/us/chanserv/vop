*** ChanServ Help - Command: VOP ***
Maintains the Voice-Op List for a channel. VOP's are auto-voiced when
they join the channel and have access to the UNBAN and INVITE commands.

LIST command displays the current Voice-Op list; if a mask is given,
only those entries matching the mask are displayed.

to maintain it if it's locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one
will be locked.
