*** ChanServ Help - Command: HOP ***
Maintains the Auto-HalfOp List for a channel. HOP's are auto-halfopped when they join
the channel, and have access to the UNBAN and INVITE commands.
 
Syntax:
/cs HOP #channel ADD <nick|mask>
/cs HOP #channel DEL <nick|mask|number>
/cs HOP #channel LIST [pattern]
/cs HOP #channel FIND <mask>
/cs HOP #channel CLEAN
/cs HOP #channel EXPLIST
/cs HOP #channel WIPE
/cs HOP #channel LOCK [nick|mask]
/cs HOP #channel UNLOCK [nick|mask]
 
The HOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the Auto-HalfOp list. If the nick or
mask is already present on the list, its access level is changed to the HOP level.
 
The HOP DEL command removes the given nick or mask from the Auto-HalfOp list.
 
The HOP LIST command displays the current Auto-HalfOp list; if a mask is given,
only those entries matching the mask are displayed.
 
The AOP FIND command search the entries matching the given mask (in the nick!user@host format)
 
The HOP CLEAN command removes all the expired nicks from the Auto-HalfOp list.
 
The HOP EXPLIST command displays all the expired nicks in the Auto-HalfOp list.
 
The HOP WIPE command removes all nicks and masks from the Auto-HalfOp list.
 
The HOP LOCK command locks the Auto-HalfOp list. Only the founder will be able
to maintain it if it's locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one
will be locked.
 
The HOP UNLOCK command unlocks the Auto-HalfOp list if it was previously locked.
If a single entry is specified, only that one will be unlocked.
