*** ChanServ Help - Command: SOP ***
Maintains the Super-Op List for a channel. SOP's are auto-opped when they join
the channel, and they can maintain the AutoKick, the AOP, the HOP and the VOP list.
 
Syntax:
/cs SOP #channel ADD <nick|mask>
/cs SOP #channel DEL <nick|mask|number>
/cs SOP #channel LIST [pattern]
/cs SOP #channel FIND <mask>
/cs SOP #channel CLEAN
/cs SOP #channel EXPLIST
/cs SOP #channel WIPE
/cs SOP #channel LOCK [nick|mask]
/cs SOP #channel UNLOCK [nick|mask]
 
The SOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the Super-Op list. If the nick or
mask is already present on the list, its access level is changed to the SOP level.
 
The SOP DEL command removes the given nick or mask from the Super-Op list.
 
The SOP LIST command displays the current Super-Op list; if a mask is given,
only those entries matching the mask are displayed.
 
The AOP FIND command search the entries matching the given mask (in the nick!user@host format)
 
The SOP CLEAN command removes all the expired nicks from the Super-Op list.
 
The SOP EXPLIST command displays all the expired nicks in the Super-Op list.
 
The SOP WIPE command removes all nicks and masks from the Super-Op list.
 
The SOP LOCK command locks the Super-Op list. Only the founder will be able
to maintain it if it's locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one
will be locked.
 
The SOP UNLOCK command unlocks the Super-Op list if it was previously locked.
If a single entry is specified, only that one will be unlocked.
