*** ChanServ Help - Command: CFOUNDER ***
Maintains the Co-Founder list for a channel. CF's are auto-opped
when they join the channel, can maintain the AutoKick, SOP, AOP and
VOP lists, and have access to all the SET commands except:
SET FOUNDER, SET PASSWD, SET SUCCESSOR, SET MEMOLEVEL and SET NOMKICK.
 
Syntax:
/cs CF #channel ADD <nick|mask>
/cs CF #channel DEL <nick|mask|number>
/cs CF #channel LIST [pattern]
/cs CF #channel FIND <mask>
/cs CF #channel CLEAN
/cs CF #channel EXPLIST

mask is already present on the list, its access level is changed to the CF level.
