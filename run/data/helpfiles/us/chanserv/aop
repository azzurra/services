*** ChanServ Help - Command: AOP ***
Maintains the Auto-Op List for a channel. AOP's are auto-opped when they join
the channel, and have access to the UNBAN and INVITE commands.
 
Syntax:
/cs AOP #channel ADD <nick|mask>
/cs AOP #channel DEL <nick|mask|number>
/cs AOP #channel LIST [pattern]

/cs AOP #channel WIPE
/cs AOP #channel LOCK [nick|mask]

ADD command adds the given nickname to the Auto-Op list. If the nick or
mask is already present on the list, its access level is changed to the AOP level.
 
DEL command removes the given nick or mask from the Auto-Op list.
 
LIST command displays the current Auto-Op list; if a mask is given,
only those entries matching the mask are displayed.

to maintain it if it's locked. If a single entry is specified, only that one
will be locked.

If a single entry is specified, only that one will be unlocked.
