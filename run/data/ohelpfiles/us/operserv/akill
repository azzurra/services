*** OperServ Operator Help - Command: AKILL ***
Allows IRCops to manipulate the AKILL list. If a user
matching an AKILL mask attempts to connect, Services
will instruct all servers to add an AKILL for the mask
which the user matched.
 
Syntax: AKILL ADD|PERM user@host reason
        AKILL TIME expiry user@host reason
        AKILL DESC user@host description
        AKILL ENABLE|DISABLE user@host
        AKILL ID id_number
        AKILL REASON user@host newreason
        AKILL LIST [start [end]] [pattern]
 
TIME adds a temporary AKILL. expiry must be an integer
followed by one of d (days), h (hours), or m (minutes).
If a unit specifier is not included, the default is days
(so +30 by itself means 30 days).
 
ID returns the user@host mask of an AKILL.
You cannot remove an AKILL by ID.
 
DESC adds a description to the given AKILL, viewable
only by opers.
 
ENABLE and DISABLE temporarily enable/disable an
AKILL without having to remove it and readd it later.
 
This command is limited to Services Operators.
